days for the fed to kick off the ratecutting cycle with a bang the unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year though from an unusually low point economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise it tends to catch momentum and keep rising that has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the us economy a scenario in which inflation is tamed

owners there were having trouble finding workers after the covid pandemic but while he is defending the haitians legally working in springfield with temporary protected status due to violence and a humanitarian crisis after storms and an earthquake there dewine wants to separate them from the larger immigration and border debate fueling the republican political argument in the immigration issue and the border issue obviously is fair game dewine said in the pbs interview and its a refrain he has repeated in press conferences and interviews in recent days and on this point there seems to be an ocean of disconnect between republican leaders in ohio who argue that haitians filled a desperate need in springfield and donald trump and ohio sen jd vance who argue as vance did that thousands of residents have had their lives destroyed by the arrival of the haitians like dewine springfield mayor rob rue has also tried very hard to correct the record on the role haitians are playing in

his sexual desires protect his reputation and conceal his conduct for more than adecade specifically the indictment accuses combs of working with other associates and employees alleges he hosted

combs lawyer marc agnifilo told cnns kaitlan collins on tuesday night that combs will likely not take a plea deal i believe hes innocent of the charges and he is going to go to trial and i believe hes going to win agnifilo said combs is a serial abuser and a serial obstructor prosecutors say in court tuesday assistant us attorney emily johnson said combs should be detained because he is a serial abuser and a serial obstructor adding pretrial services also recommended detention agnifilo asserted the case is about one victim an argument fiercely opposed by federal prosecutors in a rebuttal johnson emphasized this is not a case about one victim there are multiple victims since last november combs has been hit with lawsuits nine directly accusing him of sexual assault members and associates of the combs enterprise engaged in and attempted to engage in among other activities sex trafficking forced labor interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution narcotics offenses kidnapping arson bribery and obstruction of justice the indictment states file sean diddy combs arrives at the la premiere of the four battle for stardom at the cbs radford studio center on may in los angeles photo by willy sanjuaninvisionap file willy sanjuaninvisionwilly sanjuaninvisionap related article takeaways from the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking indictment against sean diddy combs during combs detention hearing federal prosecutors said at least a dozen witnesses personally observed the music moguls violence against women or the injuries they sustained at his hands prosecutors also noted combs had reached out to victims and witnesses some of whom are scared of him the attorney for dawn richard a former member of the musical group danity kane who is accusing combs of sexual battery in a separate lawsuit told cnn the federal prosecutors revelation about a witness in richards own case receiving phone contacts from combs within the four days after the complaint being filed was shocking that was jarring phone contacts then after the witness made the statement not a single phone contact after from mr combs attorney arick fudali said agnifilo on tuesday called combs reachout to the witness the furthest thing from obstruction and said the witness had a different experience that would play out at trial erica wolff another combs attorney denied the allegations in the separate lawsuit in a statement to cnn and accused richard of having a financial motive agnifilo told cnn on tuesday night that he has flown around the country interviewing a large number of men who are alleged witnesses in the case and argued the freak offs what the indictment described as elaborate and produced sex performances in which he drugged and coerced victims into extended sex acts with male sex workers were consensual acts among adults nobody was too drunk nobody was too high he said sex trafficking charge centers on video the indictment accuses combs of years of abuse that was at times verbal emotional physical and sexual combs engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals the indictment states johnson told the judge tuesday that the investigation uncovered evidence of combs allegedly assaulting victims by choking hitting kicking and dragging victims the physical abuse in particular was recurrent and widely known the indictment states and occurred on numerous occasions from about and continued for years the sex trafficking charge is based on allegations against a single unnamed victimi from about up to about the indictment states the indictment highlights a march incident which was captured on video and later publicly reported showing combs kicking dragging and throwing a vase at a woman when a hotel staffer intervened combs attempted to bribe them for their silence the indictment adds the details match up with cnns reporting in may of the video that showed combs beating and kicking his thengirlfriend casandra ventura at a los angeles hotel she is not named in the indictment sean combs and casandra ventura are seen in security video in obtained by cnn in november ventura sued combs and accused him of rape and years of abuse in response an attorney for combs said he vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations they settled the lawsuit a day after it was filed attorney douglas wigdor who represents ventura said in a statement tuesday in response to the numerous inquiries we have received regarding the indictment of sean combs neither ms ventura nor i have any comment the explosive surveillance video contradicted combs earlier comments denying wrongdoing and days afterward he posted an instagram video apologizing that video has since been deleted my behavior on that video is inexcusable i take full responsibility for my actions in that video he said combs attorney argued the video is not evidence of sex trafficking as prosecutors suggested but evidence of combs having more than one girlfriend and getting caught this was just a matter of personal embarrassment because he and the person in the video were in the midst of a year relationship that was difficult at times it was toxic at times but it was mutually so agnifilo told cnn tuesday night diddys attorney pledges he wont flee and has earned courts trust agnifilo asked the court tuesday to allow combs to remain out on bond prior to trial saying he had no plans to flee and had earned the courts trust the attorney said he took combs and his family members passports and reported all of his domestic travel since he became involved in the investigation as a show to prosecutors they were taking this seriously in addition combs is in treatment and therapy which agnifilo argued was a reason for release agnifilo said he knew the music mogul was going to formally face charges on march when the homeland security investigations agency led dramatic searches of his los angeles and miami homes marc agnifilo lawyer for sean diddy combs speaks outside federal court after combs arraignment hearing on september in new york angela weissafpgetty images law enforcement seized guns ammo drugs and a huge collection of baby oil and lubricant during the searches according to the indictment the indictment accuses combs of brandishing firearms to intimidate and threaten others by september agnifilo said he realized an indictment was coming down in a matter of weeks maybe months so he urged combs to fly to new york agnifilo said he called federal prosecutors and said his client was willing to surrender when asked how combs defense team would assure the court he wouldnt pose a flight risk or communicate with witnesses as prosecutors argued tuesday agnifilo said the most important thing even more than the passport is that mr combs came to new york on september agnifilo said he will argue the same points

the best decisions for the economy even when theyre politically unpopular democracies around the world countries that are like the united states have independent central banks and the reason is that

down significantly and more buyers are starting to take advantage by next year i expect even more buyers to see that rates have come down and decide that its a good time to buy or at least a better

to raise or lower interest rates by no more than a quarter point at an individual meeting unless theres reason to believe that economic conditions will change substantially in the coming months so the decision to cut rates by a half point wednesday even though fed officials have said throughout the year that they dont foresee the economy entering a recession was somewhat unusual fed chair jerome powell justified wednesdays decision saying in a postmeeting press conference that people should take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind in other words fed officials likely believe the

during a press conference in washington dc today from federal reserve the decision to cut by half a percentage point rather than by a more standard quarter point telegraphs to the world that central bankers feel a sense of urgency to provide the us economy with swift relief from elevated borrowing costs the fed has walked a fine line in taming price pressures without sacrificing americas job market an extremely difficult task because rate hikes function by deliberately cooling the economy that tool wielded by the fed is typically described as a sledgehammer not a scalpel despite inflation receding jitters remain mostly centered around the job markets future now rather than the possibility of inflation getting stuck or reigniting thats precisely why there were blaring calls in recent days for the fed to kick off the ratecutting cycle with a bang the unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year though from an unusually low point economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise it tends to catch momentum and keep rising that has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the us economy a scenario in which inflation is tamed

cut is colliding with presidential politics from cnns kayla tausche the federal reserve cut interest rates for the first time in the biden era after the white house spent the last three years grappling with americans dissatisfaction with the cost of living the move raises new questions about the health of the economy and the impact on voters at the ballot box but it is also fresh vindication for president joe biden whose pandemicera agenda ushered in trillions of dollars in government spending which when coupled with strong demand for goods supply chain snarls and russias war with ukraine drove inflation to a fourdecade high the fed said the cut signals inflation is under control but it could also suggest the economy which is showing signs of stress is in need of a jolt

surprising given chair jerome powells history of being very methodical said jj kinahan chief executive at ig north america the fed comes in strong with a large rate cut while trying to reassure the economic outlook is strong but the two facts dont jive well together be careful a big rate cut in a slowing environment has always preceded a market drop said giuseppe sette cofounder of toggle ai

powell speaks to media during a press conference after a meeting of the federal open markets committee at the federal reserve in washington dc on july graeme sloansipa usaap the federal reserve faced pressure to start cutting rates in july but did not some investors and economists pointed to rising unemployment and how the job market can sometimes take a turn for the worse on a dime the central bank was still waiting for enough evidence that inflation had come under control but fed chair jerome powell had said a weakening job market could speed up the timing of the first rate cut the pace of the job markets slowdown seems to have done the trick but it also begs the question should the fed have cut rates in july clearly some investors believe the fed is behind the curve and the decision to cut rates by half a point fueled that fire even more its a tricky predicament for the fed and even the fact that the decision wasnt unanimous casts even more doubt over the soundness of the feds decisionmaking when will investors think the fed is ahead of the curve and proactively exercising its put this is the most important question because investors have been implicitly asking that and

halfpoint cut people who follow the federal reserves monetary policy decisions are obsessing over whether the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter point or a half point when it releases its decision at pm et on wednesday generally the fed prefers to make interest rate moves in quarterpoint increments but when it looks like theres an imminent threat to the economy typically either from prices rising too quickly or the labor market cooling too much central bankers opt for larger interest rate moves at a single meeting a week ago traders were convinced the fed would cut by a quarter point but now the majority of them are leaning toward a half point according to fed funds futures so if the fed doesnt produce what they expect that risks disappointing markets and sparking a major selloff the ironic thing about this is that for most americans the difference between a quarterpoint cut versus a halfpoint cut at this meeting will be pretty insignificant thats because it

receding jitters remain mostly centered around the job markets future now rather than the possibility of inflation getting stuck or reigniting thats precisely why there were blaring calls in recent days for the fed to kick off the ratecutting cycle with a bang the unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year though from an unusually low point economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise it tends to catch momentum and keep rising that has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the us economy a scenario in which inflation is tamed

orphe divounguy in a statement mortgage rates have doubled since contributing to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in history but have been steadily falling in anticipation of a federal reserve interest rate cut according to freddie mac the average year fixed mortgage rate fell to last week down from this years peak of hit in may while the fed doesnt directly set mortgage rates its actions affect borrowing costs nationwide the monthly payment on a typical home purchase has fallen by more than since may according to zillow however additional costs aside from monthly mortgage

over the next year that will push other interest rates down and save you money on your borrowing costs and reduce what you can earn on your savings pekicegetty images cnn high interest rates have begun their initial descent the federal reserve on wednesday announced it would cut its key overnight lending rate by half a percentage point aka basis points marking the first time the us central bank has lowered rates since march it is expected to continue cutting rates over the next year or two but federal reserve chairman jerome powell said wednesday the board will make decisions meeting by meeting based on incoming economic data barring a big economic slowdown however further cuts may be smaller eg a quarter point of todays cut powell said we made a good strong start a sign of our confidence that inflation is coming down on a sustainable basis i think well go carefully meeting by meeting federal reserve chair jerome powell departs after a press conference at the federal reserve in washington dc on july graeme sloansipa usaap related article the fed just announced a jumbosized interest rate cut the feds moves will result in lower interest rates on various consumer financial products and interestbearing accounts but dont expect wednesdays single cut or even another moderate cut or two this year to necessarily drastically alter your financial life in every way for borrowers rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankratecom and for savers these rate cuts wont erase the benefit you got from rising rates in and savers with competitive highyielding accounts will still be way ahead of the game heres a more specific look at how the feds rate cutting will affect your credit cards car loans home loans highyield savings accounts certificates of deposits and other financial accounts your credit cards it may take two or three statement cycles before you start to see a lower rate on your credit cards mcbride said but given that the average credit card rate is just under and the average rate on retail store cards is north of a half point drop may not help much even if a sustained ratecutting campaign over the next two years pushes the average credit card rate to where it was at the start of before the fed started hiking rates to beat back inflation it will still be a pricey loan what to do if you have credit card debt the advice is the same as it ever was pay it off try to get a zerorate balance transfer card that can buy you at least to months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe if you cant secure that see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks they typically have fewer perks but their rates can be half as high said chris diodato a feeonly certified financial planner and founder of wellth financial planning your car car loan rates are likely to move down fairly quickly in response to the fed said jessica caldwell head of insights at edmundscom an online guide to car shopping in its august survey of car shoppers a majority said a fed rate cut likely would affect the timing of their purchase but heres the thing car loan rates are pretty high the average is for new cars and for used cars according to edmunds so a halfpoint drop may not save you as much as you think what to do every quarterpoint cut in your rate knocks a month off a typical loan on a car according to bankrate so a full percentage point drop amounts to just a month or less than a year your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose how much youre financing and your credit rating mcbride said for instance caldwell noted you may think a used car will save you money but if youre financing it do the math loans for new cars and certified preowned cars often come with subsidized loan incentives so those incentives coupled with a rate drop might result in better savings than a specific used car loan youre considering she said shop the loan see how much youll be paying in total interest over the loan term your home mortgage rates have already fallen quite a bit in recent months as of september the year fixedrate mortgage averaged thats almost two percentage points below its peak in october thats because mortgage rates are more closely aligned with movements in the year treasury yield which typically rises and falls on various economic factors eg inflation growth etc rather than being directly tied to the feds moves mcbride thinks further drops in mortgage rates if they occur will be more modest over the next year depending on the health of the economy were not going back to the sub mortgage rates of and he said what to consider if you want to buy a home figuring out when to buy a home and what you can afford isnt just a question of rates other variables like home prices and the availability of homes for sale will be just as important mcbride noted if you do buy a home this year and are considering buying down points to reduce your mortgage rate crunch some numbers first diodato advised if rates drop further and you think youll be tempted to refinance in a year or two figure out what buying down points will net you in savings he said thats because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now and then thousands more in fees to refinance to buy down a quarter of a point might cost you of your loan or for a full point he said to refinance the costs could be between and of your loan according to lending tree refinance your mortgage given where rates already are if you have a mortgage at or more mcbride said refinancing your loan may be worth it if you can get the new rate down to at least that percentage point drop could save you a month on a loan then calculate how much your refi costs will be to determine how quickly you can recoup them for instance if youre saving a month on a refi and your refi costs are below you can make that back in two years or less get a home equity line of credit if you want to take out a heloc know that its no longer cheap money to borrow average rates on helocs range roughly between and so a couple of quarterpoint rate cuts from the fed wont make it meaningfully cheaper mcbride said of course if the heloc is meant to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it the rate may not concern you but it still may cost you money by way of closing costs any minimum withdrawal requirements or an annual fee or inactivity fee mcbride noted for those who already owe money on a heloc he suggested aggressively pay it down its highcost debt that wont get significantly cheaper anytime soon your savings in the past two years it was easy for savers and retirees to make a real return or more on their cash for little to no risk if they parked their money in highyield savings accounts and various fixed income vehicles the good news bank account rates may drop but not so much that you cant continue to find returns that will handily outpace inflation which is currently very near the feds target and competition for deposits among banks mean some will continue to offer attractive returns for example plenty of online highyield savings accounts at fdicinsured banks were offering yields between and on wednesday according to listings on bankratecom such accounts are good for money youll need on hand in the next year eg for a big expense or an emergency fund by contrast regular savings accounts at big banks could earn you as little as fdicinsured certificates of deposit are also still offering inflationbeating returns at schwabcom for instance cds ranging in maturities from three months to years were offering rates of between and on shortterm treasury bills with durations of three months to one year yields were at least on wednesday morning on longerterm treasurys a twoyear note was yielding while the year offered inflation is currently according to the latest reading what to do if youre near retirement or have an intermediate term goal lock in higher rates now if youre within five years of retirement mcbride suggests that way you can grow the cash youll need to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working having that cash on hand means you wont be forced to pull from your longerterm portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement one way to do that is through buying individual cds or setting up a cd ladder which lets you allocate savings across cds of varying durations and reinvests the money when each one matures another option create a ladder of highquality bonds that reinvest every six months to a year said kathy jones chief fixed income strategist at the schwab center for financial research jones thinks that yields on treasurys which have fallen recently may have already priced in lower rates going forward so you might get better yields on aaarated corporate bonds she said for money you need access to in less than three years jones recommends putting it in money market funds focused on treasurys or topgrade municipal bonds in treasury bills with durations of less than two years or in cds for money you wont need for three to years you might consider a lowcost bond market index fund or an exchangetraded bond fund that tracks bloombergs aggregate bond index or its us corporate bond index keep the tax bite in mind too if you live in a hightax area and especially if you have a high income treasuries might be a better bet than cds since they are exempt from state and local taxes municipal bonds are typically tax exempt at the state and federal levels and some are also exempt at the local level too what to do if youre not near retirement reconsider how much money youre keeping in cash or cashequivalent investments i caution people against the cash trap a lot of people used to these nice savings rates were diverting money from stocks and longerterm bonds said diodato who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to in the next two years his advice dont keep more than six months to a years worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents anything more than that and youre putting a drag on your future net worth he said related ad feedback ad feedback cnn business videos cnn video how will rate cuts

everything from mortgages to credit cards it marks a crucial milestone for the central banks historic inflation fight which kept rates at a bruising year high for more than a year president joe biden acknowledged the feds success at such a critical juncture saying in a statement on x that we just reached an important moment meanwhile stocks seesawed after the decision was announced the decision to cut by half a point which wasnt unanimous telegraphs to the world that central bankers feel a sense of urgency to provide the us economy with swift relief from elevated borrowing costs considering there were blaring calls in recent days for the fed to kick off the ratecutting cycle with a bang still fed chair jerome powell said in a news conference that the central bank is not behind the curve and that the feds decision to cut by half a point is a sign of our commitment to not fall behind in responding to the economys reality fed governor michelle bowman who has frequently expressed worries about lingering price pressures was the lone dissenter backing a quarterpoint cut instead that was the first dissent from a fed governor since fed officials also penciled in more rate cuts by years end in their latest economic forecasts compared to the single cut in that they projected in june central bankers also expect unemployment to rise higher this year to up from the current rate of as of august despite the feds aggressive action on wednesday the central banks inflation battle in the face of immense pressure from wall street and politicians seems to be paying off so far inflation is substantially below the year highs seen in the summer of all without a recession the momentous progress seen since then isnt solely due to higher interest rates but also because of the us economys gradual recovery from severe pandemic disruptions federal reserve board chairman jerome powell speaks during a news conference after a federal open market committee meeting on september at the federal reserve in washington dc in the face of slowing inflation and strong consumer spending the federal reserve announced that it will keep the interest rate steady holding the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of to chip somodevillagetty images related livestory markets end the day higher after fed chair powells testimony before congress the fed has indeed walked a fine line in taming price pressures without sacrificing americas job market an extremely difficult task because rate hikes function by deliberately cooling the economy that tool wielded by the fed is typically described as a sledgehammer not a scalpel still despite inflation receding jitters remain mostly centered around the job markets future now rather than the possibility of inflation getting stuck or reigniting thats precisely why some called for the fed to start cutting rates aggressively the unemployment rate ratcheted up relatively quickly over the past year though from an unusually low point economists have widely said that whenever unemployment begins to rise it tends to catch momentum and keep rising that has put into jeopardy a possible soft landing for the us economy a scenario in which inflation is tamed without a sharp increase in unemployment such an outcome has only happened once in modern history in the mids so the fed is within reach of a historic achievement here are key takeaways from the feds latest rate decision powell doesnt think the fed is playing catchup the fed faced pressure to start cutting rates in july but did not some investors and economists pointed to rising unemployment and how the job market can sometimes take a turn for the worse on a dime the central bank was still waiting for enough evidence that inflation had come under control but powell had said a weakening job market could speed up the timing of the first rate cut the pace of the job markets slowdown seems to have done the trick but it also begs the question should the fed have cut rates in july clearly some investors believe the fed is behind the curve and the decision to cut rates by half a point fueled that fire even more its a tricky predicament for the fed and even the fact that the decision wasnt unanimous casts even more doubt over the soundness of the feds decisionmaking us consumers are feeling more positive about prices with expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead reaching the lowest reading since december frederic j brownafpgetty images related article slower inflation is boosting americans attitudes toward the economy powell doesnt agree with that perception he said the fed is simply committed to maintaining the labor markets strength meaning that officials arent trying to put out a fire but rather shape an insurance policy with their rate cuts that explanation could appease wall street when will investors think the fed is ahead of the curve and proactively exercising its put this is the most important question because investors have been implicitly asking that and hoping for this outcome all summer long jason draho head of asset allocation cio americas at ubs financial services said in a recent analyst note he added that the feds commitment to extending the us economys expansion is key for investors confidence powell also said that additional jumbosized cuts arent necessarily coming down the pike showing that the fed perhaps isnt playing catchup saying that i do not think that anyone should look at that and say this is the new pace powell thinks the economy is in good shape the fed chief was unequivocal in expressing his optimism about the broader us economy and its outlook including the job market the federal reserve is expected to introduce a rate cut this month but the condition of the labor market could affect whether or not its a jumbosized one lynne sladkyap related article the sky is not falling us economy added jobs in august the labor market is in solid condition and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there powell said you can say that about the whole economy the us economy is in good shape its growing at a solid pace inflation is coming down the labor market is at a strong pace we want to keep it there thats what were doing his characterization squares out with the numbers employers have continued to add jobs at a healthy pace and unemployment remains at historically low levels despite slower momentum recently but powell cautioned that the labor market is no longer where it was on the eve of the pandemic which he previously said but rather that it is now less tight than it was in late the fed chief underscored the tough balancing act officials are forced to contend with in trying to finish the job dealing with inflation and preventing a deterioration in the job market which could be hard to remedy the fed chief addresses the political optics again powell is typically asked about perceptions that the feds decision is being driven by politics especially with the us presidential election coming up his response is usually along the lines of the fed being an apolitical agency that makes its decisions based on the story that economic figures tell former president donald trump has said that if he were elected to a second presidential term he would not reappoint powell and would even push to have a greater say in monetary policy powell said such a shift would be a bad thing for the soundness of the feds decisionmaking in response to a question posed by cnns matt egan democracies around the world countries that are like the united states have independent central banks and the reason is that people have found over time that insulating the central bank from direct control by political authorities avoids making monetary policy in a way that favors maybe people in office as opposed to people who are not in office powell said we do our work to serve all americans were not serving any politician any political figure any cause any issue nothing its just
